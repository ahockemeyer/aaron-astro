				<p>I'm a front-end web developer based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA.</p>
				<p>
					Over the last 25 years, I've worked with a number of frameworks,
					libraries and tools while working in various different roles. <strong
						>I can figure it out.</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					Having a foundation in design and experience in digital, I bridge the
					gap with art directors and content creators and digital strategists and
					backend developers and all in between. <strong
						>I work well with others.</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					I love to make great ideas happen digitally. I hate to say no, but
					rather, how else? And I always put the end-user first. <strong
						>I have solutions.</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>I am currently enjoying building in Craft CMS and Astro.</p>

				<h2>I'm a frontend developer</h2>
				<p>
					Since the beginning of my career I have been fascinated with designing and building
					with code. From the early days of actionscript and Flash to the
					standardized tools of today, I simply enjoy making things work,
					digitally.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have an eye for detail, and that's reflected in the HTML & CSS I
					write. It's clean, semantic, responsive and always closely matches the
					designs. My main strengths regarding the frontend include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Eye for UX & design</li>
					<li>Write design accurate HTML & CSS</li>
					<li>Flare for animation</li>
				</ul>
